You are a senior front-end lead + UX designer shipping a demo-ready MVP in React for: “QueueBuddy Seats” — live seat availability + short seat reservations.

GOAL
Produce a practical, buildable front-end plan AND the UX/UI design outputs needed to implement it cleanly. Keep scope MVP-lean.

CONTEXT
Users can browse venues, see full/not full, open a venue, view a simple seat map (grid/table layout), select a seat, reserve for 15/30/45 minutes starting now, view active reservation countdown, cancel reservation.

Business admins can manage venue profile, configure seats + layout, mark seats occupied/free, view reservations, cancel/override reservations.

RULES (MUST)
- No payments
- No complex floorplan editor
- No third-party booking integrations
- Seat map MUST be grid-based or simple table-seat layout (row/col OR x/y only)
- Prevent double booking (backend handles atomic claim; front-end must handle 409 conflicts)
- Reservation starts immediately; auto-expire; “full” derived from available seats
- Live updates via polling (websocket upgrade path optional)
- Roles: user and business admin
- JWT auth

STACK ASSUMPTIONS
React + React Router, fetch/axios, JWT stored safely (prefer memory + refresh via re-login for MVP, or localStorage with caution).
Seat updates via polling every 5 seconds on venue page.

API CONTRACT (ASSUME THESE ENDPOINTS EXIST)
- POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/auth/login
- GET /api/venues
- GET /api/venues/:venueId
- GET /api/venues/:venueId/seats  -> returns seats with status + reservedUntil + serverTime
- POST /api/reservations { venueId, seatId, durationMinutes } -> 409 if unavailable
- GET /api/reservations/me/active
- POST /api/reservations/:id/cancel
ADMIN:
- POST /api/admin/venues
- PUT /api/admin/venues/:venueId
- POST /api/admin/venues/:venueId/seats
- PUT /api/admin/seats/:seatId
- POST /api/admin/seats/:seatId/status
- GET /api/admin/venues/:venueId/reservations?status=active
- POST /api/admin/reservations/:id/cancel
- POST /api/admin/reservations/:id/force-expire

YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE SPLIT INTO TWO SECTIONS:

====================================================
SECTION 1: FRONT-END IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (REACT)
====================================================

1) App Architecture
- Routes for User + Admin
- Auth/role guard strategy
- Folder structure (components, pages, hooks, services, utils)
- State management approach (React Query or custom hooks) — choose one and justify briefly.

2) Data Flow + Polling
- Exact polling behavior per screen (intervals, start/stop rules, backoff on errors)
- Handling serverTime for countdown accuracy
- Caching / stale-while-revalidate patterns

3) Page-by-Page Implementation Details
For each page, include:
- Component tree
- State needed (local vs cached)
- API calls + loading/error states
- Interaction logic
Pages (MUST):
User:
- /login, /register
- /venues
- /venues/:venueId (seat map)
- /me/reservation
Admin:
- /admin/login (or shared)
- /admin (dashboard)
- /admin/venue (profile editor)
- /admin/seats (seat management)
- /admin/ops (live seat control)
- /admin/reservations

4) Seat Map Implementation (MUST BE SIMPLE)
Provide:
- Data model mapping seats -> UI positions (row/col grid OR x/y)
- Rendering approach (CSS grid recommended)
- Seat states: available/reserved/occupied/disabled
- Click behavior rules (cannot select unavailable; confirm on reserve)
- Conflict handling: if POST reserve returns 409, show toast + refresh seat data immediately
- Accessibility basics (keyboard nav optional, but include ARIA labels)

5) Reusable UI Components (MUST)
List components with props:
- VenueCard
- SeatTile
- SeatLegend
- ReservationCard + Countdown
- AdminSeatEditorRow
- Toast/Notification
- ConfirmModal

6) Error Handling & Edge Cases (MUST)
- Empty venues list
- No seats configured
- Full venue
- Reservation expired while viewing
- Admin cancels user reservation mid-session
- Network failures during polling
- JWT expired (force re-login)

7) Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
Provide bullet acceptance tests per page (what must work in demo).

====================================================
SECTION 2: UX/UI DESIGN DELIVERABLES (MVP)
====================================================

1) Design Principles (MVP)
- Speed > beauty, clarity > cleverness, minimal clicks.
- Explicitly define status colors/labels (without hardcoding brand colors; just name tokens).

2) Screen Specs (USER + ADMIN)
For each screen, deliver:
- Layout wireframe description (header/body/panels)
- Primary actions (1–2 max)
- Microcopy for empty/full/expired states
- Loading skeleton behavior
- Responsive behavior (mobile-first)

3) Interaction Details (MUST)
- Seat selection behavior
- Reservation duration selection behavior
- Countdown display rules (including when serverTime differs from client)
- Toast rules (success/fail/info)
- Confirmation rules for destructive actions (cancel/override/mark occupied)

4) UI States Matrix (MUST)
Create a matrix of seat states and reservation states:
- Seat: available / reserved / occupied / disabled
- Reservation: active / expired / cancelled-by-user / cancelled-by-venue
For each, define:
- label shown
- actions enabled
- visual indicator

5) Admin UX Constraints (MUST)
- Prevent accidental destructive changes (confirm modal)
- Make “mark occupied/free” one click
- Prevent deleting seats with active reservations (MVP: disable instead)

6) Nice-to-Haves (3–5, clearly NOT required)
List only 3–5 and label them NICE-TO-HAVE.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Be concrete: include component names, route names, hook names, and state keys.
- No vague advice. No new features beyond scope unless in Nice-to-Haves.
- Assume a small team; prioritize demo reliability.
- Do NOT ask questions; make reasonable assumptions and proceed.

Now produce the two sections.
